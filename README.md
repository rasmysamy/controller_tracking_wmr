# Inside-out optical tracking of VR controllers

This project implements real-time ab-initio tracking of VR controllers which use LED constellations, given a list of LED positions and orientations for each controller.

The project is mainly set up for WMR VR controllers and cameras, and takes configuration as such, but it can be configured for any LED constellation and any camera system.
